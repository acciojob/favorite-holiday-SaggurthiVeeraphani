	<h1>Mumbai</h1>
	<br>
	<p>The oldest known names for the city are Kakamuchee and Galajunkja; these are sometimes still used.[36][37] In 1508, Portuguese writer Gaspar Correia used the name "Bombaim" in his Lendas da √çndia (Legends of India).[38][39] This name possibly originated as the Galician-Portuguese phrase bom baim, meaning "good little bay",[40] and Bombaim is still commonly used in Portuguese.[41] In 1516, Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa used the name Tana-Maiambu: Tana appears to refer to the adjoining town of Thane and Maiambu to Mumbadevi.</p>
